# RapiDelivery: Parcel Cost Calculator

RapiDelivery is a simple Python-based program designed to help a courier company calculate the cost of sending a parcel. This includes the original price of the package, transportation charge, insurance charge, gift wrapping charge, and priority delivery charge.

Features

• Input the price of the package

• Choose the delivery option: by air or other freight

• Choose the insurance type: full or limited

• Choose if the package needs to be wrapped as a Christmas gift

• Choose if it's a priority delivery

Each option corresponds to a specific cost, and the program adds all these costs to provide the final amount to be paid.

How to Run

1) Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2) Clone this repository to your local system.
3) Open your terminal/command line in the repository folder.
4) Run the script with the command python courier.py 

Input/Output

The program will interactively request inputs. For example, it will ask for the original price of the package, the distance to the recipient's address, and delivery options. Once all inputs are provided, it will output the total amount to be paid to send your package.

Future Scope

There are plans to add features like tracking parcel, delivery speed options, and international delivery in the future. Contributions are welcomed.
